## Next Generation Sequencing

### Sequence Processing 

Sequence Processing includes tasks such as demultiplexing raw read data, and trimming low quality bases.

* [Seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) - Toolkit for processing sequences in FASTA/Q formats.
	* FASTQ --> FASTA conversion
	* Nucleotide Composition (Number of A,T,C,G)
	* Add point mutations to FASTA

### Sequence Alignment

__De Novo Alignment__

__DNA Resequencing__

* [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) - Burrow-Wheeler Aligner for pairwise alignment between DNA sequences. 

### Variant Calling

* [samtools/bcftools/htslib](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) - A suite of tools for manipulating next-generation sequencing data.
	* SNVs
	* Indels - Called using gapped alignments. 

### Variant Filtering / Quality Control

### Variant Prediction
